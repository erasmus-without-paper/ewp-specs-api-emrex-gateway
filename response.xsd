            This schema is a part of the Erasmus Without Paper project. Before you start
            using it, make sure you have read the general rules described here:

                            The URL at which the student's browser is to be redirected.

                            Once this URL is received, the client should redirect the student's browser at
                            this address. This will resume the "usual" EMREX NCP progress. The ToR will be
                            transferred exactly in the same fashion as it has been defined in the original
                            NCP specification. The client will expect to receive it at its `returnUrl`
                            callback page.

                            Note, that the work of EMREX Gateway API is complete once `redirect-url` is
                            received be the client. All the remaining stages of the process *don't* make
                            use of EWP, nor its security methods. So, for example, the ELMO result will not
                            be signed with EWP's HTTP Signature, etc (however, it will still be secured
                            with security methods defined in EMREX).
